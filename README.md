The New York Times Mini Crossword Puzzle is created by Joel Fagliano and updated daily. Every puzzle consists of 5 down and 5 across clues, except Saturday's puzzle, which is not in the scope of this program. The goal of this program is to solve the crossword using the given clues on The New York Times Mini Crossword webpage, while keeping the geometry and the solutions the same as the puzzle given on the The New York Times webpage.
